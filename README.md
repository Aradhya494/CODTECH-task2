## Overview of the Project

### Project: Linkedlist Implementation

### Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a singly linked list in the C programming language that performs core operations such as:

- Insertion – Adding new nodes to the list.

- Deletion – Removing specific nodes from the list.

- Traversal – Navigating through the list to display or process its elements.

### key Activities

1. Create a Program for a Singly Linked List:

 - Implement a singly linked list data structure in C.

 - Use a modular and structured approach.


2. Implement Core Operations:

 - Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or at a specified position.

- Deletion: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or at a specified position.

- Traversal: Display all elements in the linked list.


3. Deliverable:

- Submit a modular and efficient implementation of the linked list.

- Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.


### technologies Used
 C Language
 - Used for writing the implementation of the singly linked list, including memory management and pointer operations.
Data Structure
 - Singly Linked List
    .A linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

### Key Insight
1. Understanding Dynamic Memory Allocation:
  - we gain hands-on experience with malloc and free to dynamically manage memory for each node in the list, which is critical for managing memory efficiently in C.
2. Mastery of Pointers and Structures:
  - Implementing a linked list strengthens your understanding of pointers, structs, and how they work together to create dynamic data structures.
